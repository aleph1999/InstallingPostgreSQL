# InstallingPostgreSQL
 
 Hello to you all! Kindly find below some details of my experience in installing PostgreSQL for MacOS users. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The simplest and most time efficient way of installing PostgreSQL is to simply download the Postgress App.
 This method ensures you do not run into minor installation issues that can prevent you from moving on further. 
 
 To begin with download the app at the following link:
 https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html
 
 Once downloaded and placed in the application folder, you may begin to build powerful databases. In order to save time and 
 avoid headache, I suggest you install a UI (User interface) that allows you to build queries, view structure and understand   content. 
 
 The two most well known UI's are: 
 
 1) PGAdmin (available at: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-macos/)
 2) PSequel (available at: http://www.psequel.com/)    ** preferred among Mac users.
